# Simple Parser

Simple parser is a Context-Free-Grammar parser using Earley algorithm.

Terminal symbols can have output here, so we can use it for simple translaton.

### Grammar Format

Grammar should be written in XML conforming to [the schema](Grammars/Schema.xsd).

[ChineseNumber](Grammars/ChineseNumber) is a example for translating digits to its Chinese reading.
